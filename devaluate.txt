devaluate
	#devaluate + #intelligence
		Dont worry, you're good looking; you don't have to be smart.
		I can see why you'd believe that
		If you were any slower you’d be going backwards.
		Why are you the way you are?
		Alright smooth brain
		I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you.
		If I agreed with you, we’d both be wrong.
		I dont have the time or the crayons to explain it to you
		How about you wipe your butt with that opinion?
		You make me wish I had more middle fingers.
		How should I describe this to someone like you? ...
		"Thinking isn't for everyone, now is it?"
		Well, not everyone is able to think critically
		Did your parents have ANY children that weren't born brain-dead?
	#devaluate + #existence
		Somewhere in the world theres a tree working hard to replace the oxygen youre wasting.
		I envy those who don’t know you
		You were the insparation for condoms.
		Your mom should’ve swallowed you
	#devaluate + #Advice
		Your advice is like you - unwanted and useless
	#devaluate + #Appearance
		I didn't realise they let failed experiments out of the laboratory
		You should appear in a condom commercial
		You're proof that God makes mistakes.
	#devaluate + #parents
		Somebody peed in your mother.
	#Devaluate + #ego
		I would talk down to you but I can't dig that deep.
		You definitely have something more than me, a chromosome maybe?
			If I wanted to kill myself, I would jump from your ego down to your IQ
		I'm sorry, were you saying something?
		Your only value is as fertilizer for my garden.
		I probably would despise you, if I ever thought about you.
		You're a great converstaion topic. Not when you're here but when you leave.
	#devaluate + #career
		What the hell have you been doing the last ten years??
